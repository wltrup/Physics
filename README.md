## Physics
Here you'll find an assortment of technical essays I've written over the years either as part of other research, or as teaching aids, or as pass-time exercises when I had nothing more interesting to occupy myself with. Nothing here is truly original, except perhaps for the presentation. Some of them are still works in progress.

##### (2014) [The Equilibrium of a Tilted Soda Can](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-The-Equilibrium-of-a-Tilted-Soda-Can)
Did you know that you can balance a partially filled soda can when it's tilted? Here I analyse the mathematics of why and when that is possible.

##### (2014) [Relativity for non-physicists](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-Relativity-for-non-physicists)
An essay about light, the appearance of objects, and the theory of relativity, for non-physicists. 

##### (2010) [ Electrostatic Potential Between Two Spherical Conductors](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-The-Electrostatic-Potential-Between-Two-Spherical-Conductors)
A non-trivial exercise in Mathematical Physics and its applications to Classical Electromagnetism, this essay solves in detail the problem of computing an analytical solution for the electrostatic potential between two conducting spheres.

##### (2007) [On The Stability Of Stacked Cylinders](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-On-The-Stability-Of-Stacked-Cylinders)
A little exercise on elementary Newtonian mechanics to find out the minimum coefficient of friction required for a stack of cylinders not to collapse.

##### (2005) [Second Quantization](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-Second-Quantization)
What is _Second Quantization_ and where does it fit in the overall scheme of Physics? This essay is a foray into the history of the early days of Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory.

##### (2005) [Some Important Theorems in QM](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-Some-Important-Theorems-in-QM)
A review of fundamental notions in linear algebra followed by some applications in Quantum Mechanics, with an emphasis on proving some very important properties of the Hamiltonian operator.

##### (2005) [Relativistic Motion Under Constant Acceleration](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-Relativistic-Motion-Under-Constant-Acceleration)
You're on a spaceship traveling at a comfortable constant acceleration of one g. A staple of science-fiction, solved correctly and in detail.

##### (2005) [The Green function for the Helmholtz operator](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-The-Green-function-for-the-Helmholtz-operator)
Solving the _Helmholtz equation_ is a standard problem in almost any course in mathematical physics, and a simple way to introduce the notion of _Green functions_. I solve it here in full detail, explaining every step of the solution.

##### (2004) [Time Independent Degenerate Perturbation Theory](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-Time-Independent-Degenerate-Perturbation-Theory)
Nothing here is new, of course, but the formalism of Time-Independent Perturbation Theory is done in detail, with an emphasis on the degenerate case.

##### (2004) [Visual Appearance of Relativistic Objects](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-Visual-Appearance-of-Relativistic-Objects)
Have you ever wondered what objects moving close to the speed of light would look like?

##### (2004) [Projectile Motion](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-Projectile-Motion)
A summary of results of a detailed treatment of the _projectile motion problem_ in both one and two dimensions, including the effects of air resistance (using two different models for the velocity dependence).

##### (1995) [Transverse Normal Modes of a Vertical Heavy Chain](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-Transverse-Normal-Modes-of-a-Vertical-Heavy-Chain)
Derivation of the differential equation, the transverse normal modes, and their frequencies, for a heavy chain hanging vertically.

##### (1993) [Planetary Transfer Orbits](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-Planetary-Transfer-Orbits)
How do you transfer a satellite or other object in space from one orbit to another, say, from an orbit around the Earth to an orbit around Mars? You do it by applying an appropriate "delta-v", that is, by burning fuel to change the satellite's velocity until it has the appropriate value to "enter" the new orbit. From that point on, gravity does the rest so you can turn off the satellite's engines. But how is the necessary delta-v computed? Find out in this essay, for one particularly simple scenario.
