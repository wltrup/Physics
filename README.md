# Physics
A collection of technical essays I've written over the years, about Physics.

##### (1995) [Vertical Heavy Chain](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-Vertical-Heavy-Chain)
Derivation of the differential equation, the transverse normal modes, and their frequencies, for a heavy chain hanging vertically.

##### (1993) [Planetary Transfer Orbits](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-Planetary-Transfer-Orbits)
How do you transfer a satellite or other object in space from one orbit to another, say, from an orbit around the Earth to an orbit around Mars? You do it by applying an appropriate "delta-v", that is, by burning fuel to change the satellite's velocity until it has the appropriate value to "enter" the new orbit. From that point on, gravity does the rest so you can turn off the satellite's engines. But how is the necessary delta-v computed? Find out in this essay, for one particularly simple scenario.
