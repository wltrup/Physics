# Physics
A collection of technical essays I've written over the years, about Physics.

##### (2004) [Visual Appearance of Relativistic Objects](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-Visual-Appearance-of-Relativistic-Objects)
Have you ever wondered what objects moving close to the speed of light would look like?

##### (2004) [Projectile Motion](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-Projectile-Motion)
A summary of results of a detailed treatment of the _projectile motion problem_ in both one and two dimensions, including the effects of air resistance (using two different models for the velocity dependence).

##### (1995) [Transverse Normal Modes of a Vertical Heavy Chain](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-Transverse-Normal-Modes-of-a-Vertical-Heavy-Chain)
Derivation of the differential equation, the transverse normal modes, and their frequencies, for a heavy chain hanging vertically.

##### (1993) [Planetary Transfer Orbits](https://github.com/wltrup/Physics-Planetary-Transfer-Orbits)
How do you transfer a satellite or other object in space from one orbit to another, say, from an orbit around the Earth to an orbit around Mars? You do it by applying an appropriate "delta-v", that is, by burning fuel to change the satellite's velocity until it has the appropriate value to "enter" the new orbit. From that point on, gravity does the rest so you can turn off the satellite's engines. But how is the necessary delta-v computed? Find out in this essay, for one particularly simple scenario.
